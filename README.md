# Autonomous Mobile Robot Fleet Transport System Based on Machine Learning and Model Predictive Control - ZMR Project
This repo is meant to be the conclusive one for my doctoral study. The idea is to make a modular and try-my-best independent program based on Python and ROS2 so that anyone later in the field can understand and reuse this code for their own research. Cheers~
